I write this option because in the net the user have only one option to pay about this.
So let's get start.
1.Go to you joomla root directory
2.Open administrator/components/com_virtuemart/helpers/
3.In this folder just replace file "mediahandler.php"
4.And that's it.In the product edit in media tab of the bottom of the page you have new input for multiuploading files(mark images with ctr+left mouse button :))
